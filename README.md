# Overview
SEEL, short for Simple Easy Eccentric Language, is a simple modern language based on one single principle... Simplicity!  

# Why SEEL?
SEEL is meant to be used when you just want something simple that works, without all the hassle of javascript or python.

# Status
Currently SEEL is VERY early in development and is NOT something that should be used for production applications.
